                    <p>storytelling teeth into the medieval fantasy epic.
                        It's the depiction of two powerful families -- kings and queens, knights and renegades</p>

                      <h4>League of Legends</h4>
                      <p><strong>League of Legends</strong>by Riot Games</p>
                      <p>
                          In League of Legends, players assume the role of an unseen "summoner" that controls a "champion" with unique abilities and battle against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions.
                          The goal is usually to destroy the opposing team's "Nexus", a structure that lies at the heart of a base protected by defensive structures, although other distinct game modes exist as well.
                          Each League of Legends match is discrete, with all champions starting off fairly weak but increases in strength by accumulating items and experience over the course of the game.
                          The champions and setting blend a variety of elements, including high fantasy, steampunk, and Lovecraftian horror.

                      <h4>Borderlands</h4>
                      <p><strong>Borderlands.</strong>Published by 2K</p>
                      <p>The three main games in Borderlands are first-person shooters, set in an open world, with some role-playing game elements.
                          Players select one of the available characters, representing Vault Hunters that have traveled to the planet Pandora to try to seek its fabled Vault.
                          Each Vault Hunter has a different skill tree and one or more unique abilities.
                          Players then work on completing quests and exploring Pandora while dealing with the violent Pandora wildlife, crazed scavengers that have been stranded on the planet, and various military groups that attempt to stop them.
                          Completing quests and defeating foes earns in-game money and experience, which is used for expanding the player's skill tree. If the player loses their health or falls into bottomless chasms, they respawn at the most recent checkpoint and lose some of their money.
                          The games are divided into several maps, and once players have reached a waypoint station on the map, they can teleport to any other previously visited map. Otherwise, players must reach certain points on the edges of the map to move into a different area.
                          Some maps allow the player to spawn an armed vehicle to help traverse large maps or to deal with more powerful enemies.
